# Scaile SDK

Welcome to the **Scaile SDK**! This Python software development kit (SDK) allows developers to integrate with the Scaile API, providing an easy-to-use interface for managing annotations, decentralized storage, contributor rewards, and more.

With Scaile SDK, you can easily:

- **Create and manage annotations** for data.
- **Interact with decentralized storage** platforms like IPFS.
- **Calculate and distribute rewards** for contributors.

This SDK is designed to be simple and intuitive, enabling developers to build powerful applications with minimal effort.

## Features

- **Annotation Management**: Create, update, and retrieve data annotations.
- **Decentralized Storage Integration**: Upload and retrieve files from decentralized storage platforms like IPFS.
- **Contributor Reward System**: Manage and calculate rewards for contributors using token-based systems.
- **Webhook Support**: Receive real-time updates via webhooks.

## Installation

To get started with Scaile SDK, install it using `pip`:

```bash
pip install scaile-sdk
```

Or, if you prefer to install from the source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo-url/scaile-sdk.git
cd scaile-sdk
pip install .
```

Once installed, you can start integrating Scaile SDK into your application by importing it into your Python scripts.

## Quick Start

Here is a basic example of how to authenticate and fetch annotations using the Scaile SDK:

```python
from scaile.client import Client

# Initialize the client with your API key
client = Client(api_key="your_api_key")

# Fetch all annotations
annotations = client.get_annotations()

for annotation in annotations:
    print(annotation)
```

This example shows how to authenticate using your API key and retrieve annotations from the Scaile platform.
