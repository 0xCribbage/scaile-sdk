# Performance Considerations

## Network Optimization
1. Connection Pooling
   - Implement connection pooling for HTTP requests
   - Reuse connections when making multiple API calls
   - Consider using `requests.Session()` for better performance

2. Batch Operations
   - Implement batch processing for multiple operations
   - Use async/await for I/O-bound operations
   - Consider implementing rate limiting for API calls

## Memory Management
1. Resource Cleanup
   - Properly close connections and file handles
   - Implement context managers for resource management
   - Use garbage collection hints when dealing with large datasets

2. Caching Strategy
   - Implement local caching for frequently accessed data
   - Use TTL (Time To Live) for cached items
   - Consider using caching decorators for expensive operations

## Performance Monitoring
1. Logging
   - Implement structured logging
   - Include timing information for operations
   - Use appropriate log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)

2. Metrics
   - Track response times
   - Monitor memory usage
   - Implement health checks

## Example Implementation
```python
import time
from functools import wraps
from contextlib import contextmanager

# Performance monitoring decorator
def measure_time(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"{func.__name__} took {end_time - start_time:.2f} seconds")
        return result
    return wrapper

# Resource management context manager
@contextmanager
def managed_resource():
    try:
        # Initialize resource
        yield
    finally:
        # Cleanup resource
        pass

# Example usage
@measure_time
def expensive_operation():
    with managed_resource():
        # Your code here
        pass
```
