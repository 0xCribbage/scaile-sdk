## Overview

The **Scaile SDK** is a Python library designed to interact with the Scaile API. It simplifies tasks such as:

- Creating, retrieving, and updating annotations.
- Uploading and managing files on decentralized storage platforms (e.g., IPFS).
- Managing contributor rewards (e.g., calculating and distributing tokens).
- Listening for real-time notifications via webhooks.

This SDK is perfect for developers building applications that require advanced annotation management, decentralized file storage, or reward systems for contributors.

## Installation

To install the Scaile SDK, you can use `pip`:

1. First, ensure you have Python 3.8 or later installed.
2. Install the SDK using the following command:

```bash
pip install scaile-sdk
```

Alternatively, you can clone the repository and install the SDK manually:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo-url/scaile-sdk.git
cd scaile-sdk
pip install .
```

Additionally, you can install the required dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Getting Started

After installation, you can begin using the Scaile SDK in your Python projects. Below is an example to help you get started quickly.

### Example - Quickstart

```python
from scaile.client import Client

# Initialize the client with your API key
client = Client(api_key="your_api_key")

# Fetch all annotations
annotations = client.get_annotations()

for annotation in annotations:
    print(annotation)
```

This example demonstrates how to authenticate using the API key and retrieve annotations from the Scaile platform.

## SDK Components

The Scaile SDK is composed of several key components:

### Client

The `Client` class provides an interface for interacting with the Scaile API. It handles authentication, session management, and API requests.

#### Key Methods:
- `get_annotations()`: Fetches all annotations.
- `create_annotation(data)`: Creates a new annotation.
- `get_annotation_by_id(annotation_id)`: Retrieves a specific annotation by ID.

### Annotation

The `Annotation` class handles all functions related to data annotations.

#### Key Methods:
- `create(data)`: Creates a new annotation.
- `update(annotation_id, data)`: Updates an existing annotation.
- `delete(annotation_id)`: Deletes an annotation.

### Storage

The `Storage` class provides methods for interacting with decentralized storage platforms like IPFS.

#### Key Methods:
- `upload(file_path)`: Uploads a file to a decentralized platform.
- `retrieve(file_id)`: Retrieves a file from the storage.

### Rewards

The `Rewards` class manages the reward system, such as calculating tokens for contributors.

#### Key Methods:
- `calculate_tokens(contributor_id)`: Calculates the number of tokens to reward a contributor.
- `distribute_rewards()`: Distributes rewards to eligible contributors.
